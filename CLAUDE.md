# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new project related to App Store review functionality. The repository is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Initial Setup Notes

- This is a fresh repository with no existing codebase
- The project name suggests it may be related to App Store review processes or analysis
- No package managers, build tools, or frameworks have been configured yet

## Development Workflow

Since this is an empty repository, the following steps will likely be needed:

1. Initialize the project with appropriate language/framework setup
2. Configure package management and dependencies
3. Set up build and development scripts
4. Implement core functionality
5. Add testing framework and tests

## Repository Structure

Currently empty - structure will be established as the project develops.

## Notes for Future Development

- Project permissions are configured to allow basic bash operations (ls, find)
- Consider establishing coding standards and project structure early in development
- Determine the primary programming language and framework before beginning implementation
